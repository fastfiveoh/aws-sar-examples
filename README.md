## Projects

### Node.js Hello World
A short function that includes a function wrapped with [`@iopipe/iopipe`](https://github.com/iopipe/iopipe-js) plus custom metrics and tracing boilerplate.

## Building/Deploying
We rely on Circle to do the building + deployment of the packages. Deployment is done on the master branch.

To increase the version of a project, you will need to bump the version inside of the project's package.json.
